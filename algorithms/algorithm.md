# What is an algorithm
Algorithm refers to any incremental/step based process used on a data structure to achieve a desired result

Datastructures + algorithms = programs

## Base Algorithm concepts
1. Sorting - Organizing data in a specific order
2. Dynamic Programming
3. BFS + DFS (Searching)
4. Recursion

## Why use algorithms
Algorithms can improve on the native datastructure operations such as lookups, insertions, and sorting.

This adds another layer of efficiency to programming
