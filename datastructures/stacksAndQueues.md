# Stacks and Qs
## what are stacks
These are high level last in first out (LIFO) data structures used in applications where only the most recent element can be accessed.

An example of this the call stack in the js engine, limiting stacking the execution contexts and only executing the one at the very top, making the ones below wait.

## Methods vs time complexity
1. Lookup O(n)
2. Pop O(1)
3. Push O(1)
4. Peek O(1)

## What are Qs
Qs are a first in first out data stucture, creating a series of elements that are serviced on a first come first serve basis

## Methods vs time complexity
1. Lookup O(n)
2. Dequeue O(1) remove element from q
3. Enqueue O(1) adding element to q
4. Peek O(1)
