# Graphs
## What is a graph
A graph is a pictorial representaion of vertex/nodes in which some are connected by links known as edges. In js, this represents objects linked to an arbitrary number of other objects. 

Edges connecting nodes in the graph can contain their own value. This characterizes the graph as a "weighted" graph

Links may either be made in one or both direction. In the case of one, the graph becomes "directed"

The connections may allow, starting from node 0( arbitrary starting point ), to return back to 0. This is a cyclical graph.

The most common graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph(dag). Direction and cyclic are the more pertinent features
