# Dynamic Programming
## What is Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming refers to an optimization technique using caching

The core concept is solving problems by dividing them into subproblems, storing the solution in each case a problem is solved, then returning the stored solution the next time the same input is used in order to avoid processing the input again.

## What is Caching
Caching is holding data in a quickly accessible state. The principle method of caching is called Memoization

## Divide and Conquer + Memoization
In the case of recursive operations, subproblems can be stored and returned, thus eliminating the need to repeat operations.

## When Can DP be Used
1. Can be divided into subproblems
2. Recursive solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblems
4. Memoize subproblems
